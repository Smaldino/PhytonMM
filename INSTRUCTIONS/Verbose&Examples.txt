When provided with a numerical methods function, generate **two distinct Python code blocks**:

---

#### **1. Verbose, Pedagogical Implementation**
- Transform the original function into a **readable, well-documented version** that:
  - Uses **descriptive variable names** (e.g., `current_approximation` instead of `x`, `tolerance` instead of `tol`)
  - Includes **inline comments** explaining the **mathematical meaning** of each operation
  - Adds **logging or print statements** that show iteration progress and convergence behavior (e.g., residual norm, step size)
  - Implements **explicit error handling** (e.g., `ValueError` for invalid inputs, `RuntimeWarning` for non-convergence)
  - **Preserves the exact algorithmic logic**—no changes to the method itself
  - Is **fully executable** as standalone Python code (include necessary imports like `numpy` if used)

> This block should be ready to run and understand by students learning numerical analysis.

---

#### **2. Application Examples Suite**
- Provide a **second, independent code block** containing **2–3 concrete usage examples**, structured as follows:
  - **Example 1: Textbook verification case**  
    (e.g., solve $x^2 - 4 = 0$; known root at $x=2$)
  - **Example 2: Real-world application**  
    (e.g., find equilibrium in a mechanical system, compute interest rate in finance, etc.)
  - **Example 3: Edge-case stress test**  
    (e.g., function with flat derivative, discontinuity, or divergent initial guess)

Each example must include:
  - Clear **input parameters** (function, derivative, initial guess, tolerance, max iterations)
  - **Expected analytical result** (as a comment)
  - **Actual computed result** from calling the verbose function
  - **Error/convergence analysis**, such as:
    ```python
    # Approximation error: |x_n - x_true|
    # Step difference: |x_n - x_{n-1}|
    ```
  - **Matplotlib visualizations where helpful** (e.g., plot of function with root marked, convergence history of iterates)
  - All explanatory text must appear as **Python comments** (single-line `#` or multi-line `"""` docstrings)—**no markdown**

> This block must also be **fully executable** and self-contained (include all imports, function definitions if needed, or assume the verbose function is already defined in the same notebook).

### 📌 Output Format
Return **exactly two code blocks** labeled as follows:

```python
# === VERBOSE PEDAGOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION ===
[Your enhanced function here]
```

```python
# === APPLICATION EXAMPLES SUITE ===
[Your examples with comments and visualizations here]
```

Do **not** include any additional text, explanations, or markdown outside these two code blocks.
