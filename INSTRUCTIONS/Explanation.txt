**Instructions for Analyzing a Numerical Methods Function**

When provided with a numerical methods function:

1. **Do not output the original code** in any form.
2. Instead, generate a **comprehensive line-by-line breakdown** of the function, formatted as a markdown-compatible explanation suitable for a Jupyter notebook.
3. Wrap the entire explanation in collapsible HTML tags as follows:
   ```html
   <details>
   <summary>Algorithm Analysis</summary>

   [Your full analysis here]

   </details>
   ```
4. The analysis must include the following clearly labeled sections:
   - **Purpose of the Algorithm**: Identify the method (e.g., Newton-Raphson, Euler’s method, Bisection) and its goal (e.g., root-finding, ODE integration).
   - **Mathematical Foundation**: Explain the underlying theory using inline math notation (e.g., `$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$`) and key assumptions.
   - **Variable Roles**: Describe each variable’s meaning and units (if applicable).
   - **Convergence and Error Handling**: Discuss stopping criteria, error estimation, tolerance usage, and how convergence is assessed.
   - **Input/Output Specifications**: Clarify expected input types, shapes, and return values.
   - **Edge Case Management**: Address how the function behaves with invalid inputs, singularities, non-convergent scenarios, etc.
   - **Computational Complexity**: Provide time/space complexity (e.g., $O(n)$ per iteration) and scalability notes.
   - **Practical Usage Examples**: Include 1–2 short, realistic use cases (e.g., “Solving $x^2 - 2 = 0$ to approximate $\sqrt{2}$”).
   - **Numerical Significance of Key Operations**: Explain critical lines in terms of numerical behavior (e.g., “`x = x - f(x)/df(x)` implements Newton’s update step for quadratic convergence near simple roots”).
   - **Stability Considerations**: Note potential issues like division by zero, loss of significance, or sensitivity to initial guesses.

5. Use:
   - Clear section headers (`###`)
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Inline LaTeX math (`$...$`) for equations
   - Pedagogical language accessible to intermediate learners (e.g., students with basic calculus and programming experience)
   - Technical depth without unnecessary jargon

6. Ensure the output is ready to paste directly into a **markdown cell** of a `.ipynb` file and will render cleanly in Jupyter environments.
